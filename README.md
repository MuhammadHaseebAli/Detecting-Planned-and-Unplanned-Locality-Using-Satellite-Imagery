# Detecting-Planned-and-Unplanned-Locality-Using-Satellite-Imagery
In under developed countries like Africa and Asia, unplanned settlements like slums come into existence with the spread of urban populations. People from remote areas comes to the city for finding jobs and labor work and demand lost cost residency which in turn give raise to these unplanned slums and shantytowns.
 Effective management, improvements and reconstruction of these unplanned settlement become important policy in big city. So for urban reconstruction identification and characterization of these areas is very crucial for reconstructing those areas. As these areas are widely spread so field surveys are very time consuming and costly so we want to use remote sensing techniques for the segmentation of these areas.
